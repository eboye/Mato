# Create an issue
Please create a seperate issue for each icon. When creating an issue about an icon (like icon requests), please add the filename of the icon.

For apps, you can find this information in the .desktop file of the app (in /usr/share/applications/ or ~/.local/share/applications/) under `Icon`.

For mimetypes, this is the mimetype itself in the properties of the file.
